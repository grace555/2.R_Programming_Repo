###WEEK2 QUIZ
-------------

**Question 1**
============
Suppose I define the following function in R

```{r}
cube <- function(x, n) {
x^3
}  
```

What is the result of running 
```{r}
cube(3)
```
in R after defining this function?

```{r}
answer <- cube(3)
```

***answer*** : `r answer`

**Question 2**
=============
The following code will produce a warning in R.
```{r}
x <- 1:10
if(x > 5) {
x <- 0
}
```

why?
***answer*** : 'x' is a vector of length 10 and 'if' can only test a single
logical statement.

**Question 3**
============
Consider the following function :
```{r}
f <- function(x) {
g <- function(y) {
y + z
}
z <- 4
x + g(x)
}
```

If I then run in R
```{r}
z <- 10
k <- f(3)
```
What value is returned? `r k`

**Question 4**
============

Consider the following expression:
```{r}
x <- 5
y <- if(x < 3) {
NA
} else {
10
}
```
What is the value of 'y' after evaluating this expression?

**answer** : `r y`

**Question 5**
============
Consider the following R function:
```{r}
h <- function(x, y = NULL, d = 3L) {
z <- cbind(x, d)
if(!is.null(y))
z <- z + y
else
  z <- z + f
g <- x + y / z
if(d == 3L)
return(g)
g <- g + 10
g
}
```
Which symbol in the above function is a free variable?

***answer*** : f

**Question 6**
=============
What is an environment in R?

***answer*** : a collection of symbol/value pairs

**Question 7**
=============
The R language uses what type of scoping rule for resolving free variables?

***answer*** : lexical scoping

**Question 8**
=============
How are free variables in R functions resolved?

***answer*** : The values of free variables are searched for in the
               environment in which the function was defined.
               
**Question 9**
============
What is one of the consequences of the scoping rules used in R?

***answer*** : All objects must be stored in memory.

**Question 10**
=============
In R, what is the parent frame?

***answer*** : It is the environment in which a function was called
